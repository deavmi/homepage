So I have been giving some thought to the idea of starting my own blog which is not only cringe but also means I will never be a Chad because only Soy-boys write blogs.

Okay, now that I have made sure only people on the political right are still paying attention, we may continue. I was thinking of basically writing on the stuff I am currently working on, so no posts about like my trips to, I don't know, Portugal but rather academically interesting stuff. I might write either about my projects or maybe write tutorial posts that explain certain concepts that I have encountered along the way, either way I think it will be enjoyable not only for me but for more audience *crickets*.

As of now I am working on three things really, CRXN, BonoboNET and Bester. I will probably write a post in the near future explaining what they are but basically an private IPv4 Internet, an IRC network and (oh boy) something that is like XMPP except that it's generalized, okay, XMPP is too but I think mine is cooler just cause I am working on it.

Anyways, that's all for now. I have to grind at some posts explaining what the last mentioned project is so that I can actually make sure you guys know what it is and can say "Oh, that's neat".
