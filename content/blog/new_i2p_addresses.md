title: New I2P addresses

This is just a quick update that I needed to make seeing that I have switched to new I2P addresses for the services I run.

## BonoboNET

I now host I2P gateways to all BonoboNET servers. However, you should rely on the I2P destinations provided by the people who run `reddawn648.bnet` and `sparrow.bnet` (previously `rany.bnet`) rather because if my network goes down then you cannot access either of theirs via my (down) I2P router. This is just for the sake of hosting that I do this.

| Node | Destination | Security |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| `lockdown.bnet` | `vgbvuawi5y7rh32xxjlqcmsoh6quigdvypqneoidiy7y7x7r2umq.b32.i2p` | No SSL/TLS |
| `lockdown.bnet` | `q4rlhwn34fp4cjvtqa6ohi2r65okaps56vnhjnirudpjpeeqsoga.b32.i2p` | SSL/TLS |
| `sparrow.bnet` | `ufcvvibfphkkhctwl7sopdpujqwrn2mlerlnhgah63e2mkb45wkq.b32.i2p` | SSL/TLS |
| `reddawn648.bnet` | `e3ez3tyqaotkpye2yms347iysdwwqgluxlgzdfg3cqfh4uyv3lba.b32.i2p` | No SSL/TLS |
