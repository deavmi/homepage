I don't know what this phenomenon is but everytime I meet a new person called Tristan, as with myself, they always seem to be incredibly smart and on the same wavelength as me. There must be something genetic. Perhaps we are all related in some weird sort of incestural happening. Who knows but it surely didn't have any negative side effects.

All I can say is that we should probably form a _Tristan's Club_ just for all the smart Tristan's around the globe that study computer science because I think we're onto something the government doesn't want to let us know.
