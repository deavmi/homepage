Yes, I am still alive but just very busy. My honors year began about 3 weeks ago and so far things are getting very busy but my honors project itself is
going very well and I may be able to complete it probably within the next 2-3 months, it's actually a very cool project but more on that later.

As for personal stuff I probably won't have much time for it but I have a focus on the following:

1. BNET
	* Want to standardise configurations with the help of `rany`
2. CRXN
	* Want to get more peers
	* Get proper `NS` records going on my root nameserver
3. TLang
	* Continue working on the code generator/type checker
	* I actually have mae progress with respect tpo the above and have been working on little test cases and adding support for these things, so the project is definately not dead
	* _**It's alive and kicking!**_

For now that is all! I expect to have more time once my honors project is done, then I can focus on the above things and also potentially get some parts
of it open-sourced (if it isn't already, I haven't checked but I presume so), I would also like to get my findings published (I automated the testing and reporting
process which is awesome, but I promise a full blog post about this later).
