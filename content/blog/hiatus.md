Just a little update that I will be taking a few months hiatus. I recently celebrated my birthday and would like to have a bit of a break from some of my projects such that I can get a lot of work done (like my first set of exams) such that I can then have more time available to myself to actually focus well on a lot of my projects I want to finish up before year end or before the next set of exams for most of my other projects.

I might post some small updates here and there but for the most part I will be pretty quiet here as I go through the motions of studying, revising and writing papers.

I might work on some wholesome posting for the weeks to come...

## What must get done

I want to finish the following coding projects:

1. libtun
2. sweatyballs
3. almeida
    1. The project itself
    2. libyggdrasil
    3. bformat (I think just a cleanup is required)
    4. libchonky (Actually maybe it was this instead of bformat)
4. Start a redesign of DNET
    * I want to use protocolbuffers for it
    * Re-implement the server, client and APIs
    * Work on server-to-server linking
5. Continue with my tlang compiler
    * I want to finish the dependency tree code
        * Add some basic type checking
        * Add some basic code generation
    * I hope to get this all done such that by year end I have somewhat of a working product
    * After that I will work on tidying a lot of stuff up but for the most part it's looking good
        * General tidying up
        * Adding more comments and documentation
            * I want to have a written LaTeX document or something on the site explaining the source code

In terms of the projects that are more practical:

1. BonoboNET
    * Get more links up
    * Get some cool bots added to the channel
    * Web interface for
        * IRC chat
        * Registration with `NickServ`
2. CRXN
    * Finalise the documentation where it needs to be done
    * BGP
        * Start working on BGP peering
    * Get MikroTik's properly connected and working
        * So far they export routes but are not pingable?!?!
    * Get some live network details and stuff going
    * More peers and redundancy
    * Also upgrade my network's core router
        * I have ordered a new router already ))
3. I2P
    * Just some upgrades to the machines that need to be done to bring it to the newest version
4. CJDNS and Yggdrasil public nodes
    * Drommedaris project
        * Upgrade the machines and get a better internet connection (as yggdrasil kills mine sometimes)

I do think a break is well-deserved to be quite honest. I have been working very hard both at university and on my personal projects and I think it is about time I take a proper break to focus on university work again and then use my holidays along with after-exam time to really grind a lot of these projects of mine out. I need to do this as next year I will be busy with honours and won't have as much time as I'd like available to myself and hence I want to get everything in order such that they are maintanable by myself and can easily be worked on now and then throughout 2022!
