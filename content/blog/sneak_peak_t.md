I have a new project that I am working on and up until now I haven't said anything about it besides a post a while back mentioning that I am working on something cool but now you guys can pick up on a small little hint!

Yes, I am working on a project that I have been wanting to work on for years now - my own programming language. This isn't however a compiler necessarily for the sake of writing one only (despite how fun it is) but because I felt that something was missing in the programming language world and I feel like I needed to fix this. What _"this"_ is will be described in another post will be a topic for another discussion as it will include an actual announcement of the project which will be more formal than this. Anyways, I will keep us updated on the project as time goes on and I have a private journal for the project as well that will be public soon but for now everything is being done in private. In terms of a timeframe I would say that by the end of this year you will get a release of something atleast.
