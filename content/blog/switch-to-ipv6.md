# Why?

Well, this blog post should give you an idea as to why IPv6 is better than IPv4 and not just because of what you might be expecting, the cliche _"IPv6 has more addresses than IPv4"_ but more than that. There are indeed several more aspects to IPv6 that it simply does better than IPv4 ever could and I hope to convince you of those features in an effort to evangelize you.
