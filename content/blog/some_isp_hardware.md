<h2>The backstory</h2>
<p>So we have a pretty good relationship with our ISP and no I mean
it, I don't derive some sort of masochistic pleasure from it -
they're a good ISP for the most part (our package with them ain't
too good but I mean ya know it's what we bought). But they've
become I guess real friends over the time we've been with them
which has been a VERY long time (many many years).<br>
</p>
<p>As you can see I got quite a lot of stuff:<br>

<br>
So now that I've got you salivating at all of this, let's see what I
actually got and what I ended up doing with it.<br>
<br>
<h2>MikroTik<br>
</h2>
<p>First of all I got a lot of MikroTik Grooves. These are MIPS
machines that run MikroTik's proprietary RouterOS firmware but it
is very extensive in it's feature set so it's a pretty good system
but what really makes it great is that they never stop providing
you updates (that's right, each license, no matter the level,
receives lifetime updates). I had quite a few of these to update
and test which ones were in working order. Some were, some weren't
but I'd say the majority were. The other ones not working I think
some can be fixed possibly with some sort of manual flash as they
seem to flash a particular strobe that might indicate some
glistening hope for them to be redeemed.<br>

<br>
Here you can see some of them that I had to clean the bitumen (the
black water proofing grub) off of.<br>

Some more of them.<br>

<br>
This is what it looks like when powered on. If connected to a wifi
access point it will show radio strength on the other LEDs, The main
LED here shows network activity<br>
and flashes on link activity.<br>

<br>
I can tell that the cleaning process was most definitely not fun but
admiring them all was as you can see. I also scored a sector antenna
of which you can use these on too. There<br>
are also two directional antennas there too for use with a
reflector.<br>
<h2>Antennas<br>
</h2>
I also got this neat dish antenna (the reflector). It is hella
based. I really wanna use it with some of my MikroTiks.<br>

<br>
Here's a close up of the sector antenna. You can see that it has a
mounting bracket on the back of it to wrap around a mast.<br>

<br>
Also in the back you can see some reflectors for use with these
directional antennas.<br>

<br>
<h2>Routers and all</h2>
<p>I also gained some MikroTik devices other than Grooves (I must
note all are capable of the same features, they can bridge, router
and become access points). I got some of these really cool
case-less routerboards:<br>

<br>
I also got one of these nice routerBOARDS which comes in the form of
a switch-looking device. I now use it as my main switch for all of
my networking devices<br>
on my side of the house.<br>

<br>
Got 3 10/100Mbit Ethernet switches and one red routerBOARD at the
top<br>

<br>
The red routerBOARD was cool but there is something fucky on the
circuit and it fucks out, it notices link activity on links not
plugged in and yeah. Just<br>
doesn't work. Got it to work for a little while - then it ends up
acting up and stopping or becoming too unstable to use.<br>

<br>
It had this really neat touchscreen.<br>

<br>
I also ended up using this white routerBOARD below as an access
point in the garage (which really needed it), it also means the
swimming pool now has good wifi.<br>
