I started streaming a while back and this is the first stream I recoreded. The topic of discussion was on my routing protocol, sweatyballs,
and then after that it went into a discussion about kernels and operating systems.

A video of the stream is provided below in both shitty-definition (for African internet), however it is legible enough, you can find the raw segments [here](/streams/10-07-2021 - TUN D and Eidelweiss/).
