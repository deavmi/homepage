## Doing the impossible

At a young age my mother was told (about my brother Vaughan):

> ## *"your child will never read or write"*

It was from that day, after she heard those words, that she decided she would prove that person wrong.

It was a very long and arduous journey, and I take no credit for it whatsoever, I simply want to retell the true story of my brother's amazing journey, a story of how my mother's love was able to help him through everything to get him to where he is today. Like myself, me and my brother both have learning disabilities. It is what it is, nothing will change that fact - but what one can change is how one learns and the path one takes. That _is_ all I see your control.

Early on my mother was reading everything she could on ADHD, asperges and the like. We still have the books she read from then, hoping to pass them onto me and my brother for our future - if we may need them. Along with this was something that is irreplaceable - the time my mother spent in consultations, meetings with teachers and those in the field of learning who could assist.

* The hours spent
* The letters written
* The extra time concessions
* The remedial classes booked

These are just **some** of the things my mother had to do for us, and of course, for my brother. She, did it all out of love.

## Will _never_ be able to read, will _never_ be able to write

Back to that sentence, "**he would never read or write**". Perhaps, it would not be so bad. As things turned out my brother was able to take mathematics literacy (Maths Lit) - the "easier" mathematics so to speak. His passion was never mathematics, but rather art.



My brother's artistic skill has been something we knew of from a young age. If we opened one of his textbooks, like the one for Life Orientation, there were always fictional characters drawn within the margins. I don't blame him, that subject was a waste of time.

TODO Insert margin drawing?



But his choice to take art class at school was no mistake - from a young age he told my mother "I want to be with the cartoons" referring to him literally wanting to live amongst them or at least in that world. The best way for that to happen would be to start taking art classes now in the hopes one could make an entrance into that field with the hopes of making a career out of it.
