## Doing the impossible

At a young age my mother was told (about my brother Vaughan):

> ## *"your child will never read or write"*

It was from that day, after she heard those words, that she decided she would prove that person wrong.

It was a very long and arduous journey, and I take no credit for it whatsoever, I simply want to retell the true story of my brother's amazing journey, a story of how my mother's love was able to help him through everything to get him to where he is today. Like myself, me and my brother both have learning disabilities. It is what it is, nothing will change that fact - but what one can change is how one learns and the path one takes. That _is_ all I see your control.

Early on my mother was reading everything she could on ADHD, asperges and the like. We still have the books she read from then, hoping to pass them onto me and my brother for our future - if we may need them. Along with this was something that is irreplaceable - the time my mother spent in consultations, meetings with teachers and those in the field of learning who could assist.

* The hours spent
* The letters written
* The extra time concessions
* The remedial classes booked

These are just **some** of the things my mother had to do for us, and of course, for my brother. She, did it all out of love.

## Will _never_ be able to read, will _never_ be able to write

Back to that sentence, "**he would never read or write**". Perhaps, it would not be so bad. As things turned out my brother was able to take mathematics literacy (Maths Lit) - the "easier" mathematics so to speak. His passion was never mathematics, but rather art.

My brother's artistic skill has been something we knew of from a young age. If we opened one of his textbooks, like the one for Life Orientation, there were always fictional characters drawn within the margins. I don't blame him, that subject was a waste of time.

But his choice to take art class at school was no mistake - from a young age he told my mother "I want to be with the cartoons" referring to him literally wanting to live amongst them or at least in that world. The best way for that to happen would be to start taking art classes now in the hopes one could make an entrance into that field with the hopes of making a career out of it.

Many hours of studying, hard work and remedial lessons organised by my mother. Many years later my brother would finish high-school and would begin to study 2D and 3D animation:

My brother, no stranger to art, did very well with his studies in animation. He produced some great shorts or "show reels" as they call them.

His strength was in _"weight painting"_ - a process that Wikipedia can better explain:

>It is most often used for modifying¬†[weight maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_map)¬†for¬†[skeletal animation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_animation), to tweak the influence of individual¬†[bones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_animation#bone)¬†when deforming surfaces around joints.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_painting#cite_note-1)

My brother truly did (and **still** does) love art, he has created some amazing things over the past few years:

The animation industry, however, was not easy to find work in. This is not unheard of but rather a reality that sets in. You're either lucky to get picked up for a project (which may or may not pay well) or you'll be doing freelancing.

My brother never wasted any time though, he spent that year honing in on his skills. He got into game development with Unreal engine, which then lead him to learning C++ (something I have fond memories of as it was fun sitting besides him at his computer and watching). This journey lead to realise, quite quickly, that mathematics is something one really needs - specifically physics - in the game development world.

So it became my brother's next goal:

>I would learn physics and mathematics at university _even_ if that meant starting from **0**

Starting from zero indeed. Maths Lit wasn't going to cut it, you couldn't enter into a physics course without normal mathematics. No problem for Vaughan, he'd simply redo his matric with all the required subjects: physics, mathematics and chemistry


My brother exceeded very well at that and got what he needed:

{{</bruh>}}

Next step - applying to university. My brother applied to study at UNISA, one of the best online universities there is - but as we would soon see - it would be more than just online. He'd very soon be in the laboratories.

My brother had decided he would make the most of his time at university. So he decided to double major in physics _and_ chemistry.


While the rest of the family thought "let's see how far it goes" - it turned out that we would be surprised again when his first marks came back. We knew he could pass high school mathematics, because he had shown he could. **We had no idea that he would have performed this well in first year.**

But maybe that was just the typical first year fluke. It's common for many people that were high achievers in school to completely _"get humbled"_ when second year tells around.

And then the third year rolled by - much to the same result. We got the picture - my brother is actually very good at mathematics, physics, chemistry - and critical thinking. He's actually _excellent_.

Oh, and remember that chemistry stuff, well he's quite good at it. He's been to the UNISA campus in Florida several times already and had great successes with his practicals he had to perform there:

Along with this, he worked performantly under the pressure of time constraints when writing up the [numerous reports](https://vaughankildaire.github.io/artifacts/file.pdf) after each lab session.

{{</bruh>}}

Throughout this time my brother balanced studying with family life and also tutoring on the side.

I think this latter point is important. My brother went from being the kid who _"would never read or write"_ to tutoring others - never mind being able to overcome only reading or writing.

Vaughan has now tutored many students and it has been something he really enjoys. Many say that the reason he teaches so well is because he had gone through struggles much harder when he was learning, now this means he can teach in a way he may have wished to be taught when he was much younger. He grasps the concepts at such a fundamental level because of this and hopes to be able to impart such knowledge on his students.

## Well done

So we arrive at where we are today. Today my brother graduated:

And to my father as well. Whatever money was required for Vaughan's second set of studies (mathematics and so forth), you ensured he had. Whenever Vaughan was in Florida, you were there by his side taking him out to dinner - just to give him a little break from all of his tiring studies.

You were his comfort in a place far away from home. He knew that you were only a few blocks away and always available with a quick phone call.

I thank you for all of this dad, for flying up with my brother and to keeping him company when he was all by himself cooped up in his dorm room studying.

## Nossa m√£e

To my mother. You will always there for my brother, helping him and defending him. You sought that he would get the help he needed, the extra lessons, the consultations with the teaching experts - and when one of those experts said it was _impossible_ - *you proved them wrong*.

You spent so much time and energy to help my big brother, you did it all as your heart bled for him - a heart of gold üíõ. You would never take no for an answer, your son was put ahead of any of your own ambitions - we was your sole focus.

I thank you for that mom, for never giving up on my best friend, big brother.

## O fim, ou assaz o come√ßo

If there is anything to take away from this it is these few key points:

1. A mother's love defeats any naysayer
2. A father's commitment to ensuring the best education possible, by working endless hours, is unconquerable.
3. Your little brother's admiration, is unstoppable
4. And you *Vaughan*, are _**unstoppable**_.
