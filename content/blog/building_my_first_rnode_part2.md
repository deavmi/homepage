## What is this?

In the [first part](/building_my_first_rnode) of this blog series we purchased the needed parts in order to get started with setting up our RNode.

After this we then went through the process of flashing the firmware onto the device.

In this part we will go through the process of making use of our RNode.

## Before we begin

### New antennas

Before we get started here I have actually upgraded my antennas. Now I don't think this is required to do what I am doing but I wanted to play around with different antennas in any case.

All antennas shown here are those with SMA connectors as that is the only way to attach an antenna (a LoRa one at that) to this board.

The antennas that come provided with are these stubby antennas:

The other antennas I bought were these:

1. Antennas with magnetic base:

    b. These are quite nice as you can mount the base of the antenna connector to any magnetic surface. Think of maybe like the top of a car.
    c. The cable length is **3** meters
    d. You can purchase it [here](https://www.robotics.org.za/communication-wireless-Industrial/antenna-866mhz/YN-868MHZ-5DBI).
2. Longer pole antennas
