# The plan

Firstly let me describe the components for what I want to accomplish today and then also what the goals are.

## Antennas

What I wanted to get done today was to test out two of my new antennas and at a further range than I had tested before with my RNodes.

### Antenna with magnetic base

These antennas come with a $3m$ lead which means that you can place the radio and antenna at quite the distance apart. This is helpful for cases where you want the antenna to reach some place far away but at the same time you wouldn't be able to run the data cable to the radio (the RNode) at that same length.

We shall see how the above use case was rather handy for me in my setup that I had when using this antenna today.

### Longer pole antenna

These larger antennas fit the same use case of the original stubby antennas that are provided with the LoRa T3-S3 board of mine:

They are useful for portable devices that you can whip out and begin using. The antenna is probably as big as one is willing to slog around and have permanently fixed. It's also easy enough to store as it is rather rigid.

It has 3 angles it can be adjusted to on its hinge at $0$, $45$ and $90$ degrees.
