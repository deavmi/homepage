# This is the last time

Goodbyes are hard enough as they are but knowing that you are only saying goodbye to a select few is sometimes easier despite the
fact everyone is unique and irreplaceable. It is for this reason, compared to the last time I posted something along these lines with
[](), that I write this knowing something truly amazing is coming to an end.

This year had started off with me only knowing those who would be studying with me, namely Troy and Thomas. I really had no idea what
to expect and was nervous as one would be being placed in a postgraduate program where the responsibilities are greater and you
as a grown adult and student have to carry a lot more weight than you did in undergrad. I thought that, like my first three years of undergrad, that this was going to be one struggle all over again but this time with nobody to fallback onto and get help with work from. Effectively alone in a pitt of work - I didn't know what to expect. Now it wasn't all _doom-and-gloom_ - I was still optimistic but I didn't know what was _"in store"_ for me.

As time progressed I realized it wasn't all too bad, the work was at least in the domain of Computer Science, unlike the previous years where it was a mix of mathematics (upon other things), which only made things harder for me - seeing that I wouldn't call myself a great mathematician by any stretch of imagination. More importantly, I made life long friends along the way - people who could help me with the work but also, and this is really what I am thankful for, is the love and care they showed as my friends.

Mom, mommie, or _minnie üê≠Ô∏è_ - whatever the various names I have given you over the past many years together from my childhood till now. One thing has remained persistent and that is your love - your _unconditional love_. From growing up, I remember everyday in preschool assembly when all the toddlers would get together and sit on their mom or dads lap at the beginning of shool with the morning assembly. After the fist 5 minutes the mother would then leave but I didn't want you to leave - I would get sad - I would cry a little and so you stayed for the whole full 30 minutes or so. I remember those events so vividly in my memory - such a strong memory of the bond and love we have for each other. Just thinking of that touches my heart so much - it's a memory I thought I had never could recall from so many years ago but I am happy I still can - because **love is forever ‚ù§Ô∏è**. Those beginning years at Lanner House really were such beautiful memories of mine, if it wasn't for your tireless work on things such as the Parents-Teacher association (PTA) at Lanner House, organizing lessons for me at occupational therapy (OT), getting me tested for ADHD, helping me through my high school career at Bridge House with extra maths lessons - the driving from Franschoek and back - just so much that was expressed in what many don't directly see as direct displays of affection but **ought to** be seen as such.

In the more recent years, your assistance in making sure I always remembered my deadlines, helping me organize my hand writing concession for extra time at university, coming over with dad on weekends to help me clean up my apartment and restock my food supplies. There's honestly so much that I will never be able to re-pay you back for mom and it goes beyond just the mere items listed here, there's a lot that just cannot be typed out within one night's worth of writing.

The only way I can pay you back mom, is by making you proud - and that is a venture that is ongoing and has no end. It will persist even when you are long gone because I promise to make you proud no matter what.

My brother Vaughan, you are the my other half - somebody I always looked up to when growing up. You were the big boy in my world and you could always defend me from any harm or bullies that came my way, I always knew my brother would be there to protect me and there have been times where I was comforted by you are you ability to do so - I never felt afraid or at least you made me know I was safe.

Although nothing has changed in that regard, the bullies have disappeared but I know you are someone I can always be open and honest with, talk to when I am down and do the same for you when you are in need. As brothers are whole entire joruney has been one about reciprocation - if anything that is what _brotherhood_ is about!

Writing this I realise that that was the core tenant of what bonds us toghether but I couldn't help but think of all the memories that come to my head whilst sitting here, in the lab writing this during my free time. I can recall us as toddlers at Lanner House and the early days of MXiT and the funny stuff you showed me there. We can go back even _earlier than that_ to the days of us both sitting keenly ionfront of the one computer you shared with myself, mom and you and how I would watch you for hours play games like Myst, Sonic the Hedgehog 3D, Psychonauts, that "Ninja game that I can't remember", Spore and the works. You had such a creative mind and I was enthralled by your einterest both artistically and in a logical sense. You spent a lot of time figuring out puzzles in that game Myst, I recall you had a little notebookm where you drew these beautiful diagrams that emulaed what we saw on screen and worked out how to unlock these bejewled locks, interact with machinery and try to get things to work. From a young time you had the ability to logically solve things if you just put your mind to it - this point I make as it is important for later. I remmeber the days of sitting infront of the compyter and having to wait near 20 minutes for a flash movie to load, and how we would watch things on Flashportal, Albino blacksheep and Newgrounds 10 times in a row just to make the most of that fact! Those were some of my best meorie with you Vaughan and I can't believe how fast it all just flew by but the great thing about memories is that I still remember being your little bro, sitting cross legged on a chair next to you whilst younoperate the wizardy machinery that I would know to become a computer. And I have those memories stil with me, they make me smile when I think of all the cool games we played and sometimes naughty animations we watched. **I hope you remember these memories with as much love as I do too ‚ù§Ô∏è!**

As every decade goes by it seems you gain a new set of major skills in a field completely different to the ones you have known to come before and my word you impress me Vaughan - beyond anything I could ever accomplish. Firstly, it started with your art - which was - simply amazing. I can remember all of the things you have drawn, painted and digitally illustrated over the years and they are just amazing. Needless to say, your ability to do 2D/3D animation and actually make something look realistic, create detailed textures, weight painting (which is a harder thing to do in that realm) and still come up top with your results has always simply left me astounded and impressed but more importantly **proud**.

Then as time went on your interested in physics, most likely pushed by its use within 3D animation physics and game engines, started to rgow alongside with chemistry and boy did your interest peak when you started looking into maths. You really did the impossible Vuaghan, or rather I should say the _possibe_ as anything is possible if you put your mind to it. You went to re-write your mathematics papers such that you could have mathematics on your final matric instead of mathematics literacy and you excelled in those two papers you wrote. You then enrolled at UNISA and took mathematics, physics and chmeistry. Your firsdt year you did amazingly well and you are on track form doing so again this year once again, coming top in your classd multiple times, helping fellow classmates out because **you** enjoy helpging people and they way you teach is simply amazing. Your knowledge on the subject matter has always intrigued me and you always kno whot to answwer any of my dumb questions regardfing physics üòâÔ∏è - seeing just how bad my grasp on it or chemistry for that matter and matghematics is.

The other thing was your artistic nature, the drawings you you had produced over the years were some of the coolest pieces of artwork I had seen during my whole time at school whilst you were taking art classes. There are countless cases of times you have astounded me with the works you have done, all the way starting from the art class lessons we used to have as kids each Friday after school, through junior and high school - your works not only got better but they got more detailed as time went along. ENtering into your animation diploma you did at _The Animation School_ your two-dimensional (and later three-deimensional) works would keep me enthralled with both your creativity but also technical skill and ability as a lot of that work required more than just creativity - you had both of these highly sought after traits.

You're who I have always looked up to Vaughan, you're my big brother after all - you make me proud. Whether it's physics/chemistry-Vaughan, artist-Vaughan or guitarist/bassist-Vaughan - you leave me amazed.

# The fellas

There's a whole lot of you and honestly it's about time we just go heads-first into this and take a deep dive into the very eclectic bunch of people I had met/worked with this year.

## The systems programmers

You'll always appear on this list man - you're the most reliable of all my friends, always there and always willing to work together on something. Any day of the week I would be working either at the lab or (most of the time) at my apartment and I would receive a call from you as a surprise that you were in town that evening and wanted to drop by. I would never resist such an invitation as we always had so much to catch up on during those times you came to hang over. This, however, is a recent past - our friendship goes back many many years and I can only honor that by going all the way back to the origin story of our friendship.

The first time we met must have been near the end of our second semester in first year. We all had to work on that obstacle chess project, which for the uninitiated was a chess program with trapdoors, bombs, walls and so forth. I recall you showing me your version on your laptop which had these cool blood animations which would appear when a chess piece was captured - it was at that moment that I realized this guy takes this work seriously - he's a real programmer. Now, this wasn't my first encounter with you, I recall you discussing regular expressions quite a lot and how you tried using them to implement your entire chess game. _"That's crazy man - that's crazy"_, was what I was thinking whilst you continued on explaining this WILD method of implementing the matching of board states or something along those lines. Now, I was a little intimidated - I cannot lie. Here I sit on my chair in front of this tall, groot-gebou Afrikaner (10+ points) talking about regular expressions enthusiastically (as one would if they did regex in their sleep) (another 10+ points) and lastly about how it was used to implement a crucial part of the game play (1000000+ points). From this moment I knew this guy had to be my friend - he was just so smart and interested in what he was studying - something not very present at a grand scale within a single university class in my opinion at least. He was a nerd - like me and I wanted that in my friends.

It was from this day onwards that we became best buddies or _"chommies"_, we'd spend a lot of time discussing Linux, customizing our i3 setups along with Stephen and next thing you know - we had a trio consisting of you, Stephen and I - all messing around on our laptops, tweaking configurations and messing around with programming. You, specifically, had a very analytic mind in terms of solving problems. I recall you working tirelessly in your free time, whatever time you had seeing how much work we had in the first few years in our undergraduate Computer Science course, on Project Euler problems - and my word you had made it very far in solving many of those problems - something that had always amazed me. But it really came as no surprise, first the chess project written on paper, then this, it was just a clear sign of how the insides of your amazing brain worked. Real excellence üß†Ô∏è.

Our fun projects have not ended yet, if it wasn't us messing around on campus and exchanging project ideas for our assignments then we just continued that at home. It would have been impossible, without your help, to accomplish several projects of mine, these include some of the big ones like [CRXN](/projects/crxn), [BonoboNET](/projects/bonobonet) and so on. You are pivotal in my success - there is a lot more that I have to thank you for in my life. You are moraled, well-principled and consistent in my life. You never disappoint - nothing is ever too tall an ask, you're someone _I_ can aspire to be in the way you carry yourself. You are seen as family by the Kildaire's - you are truly my **best friend**.

To many more times running the following commands!

```bash
sudo routef

reboot # Oh! Now it works!

### Stephen Cochrane (_skiqqy_)

{{<bruh>}}
<img src="/img/thanks_again/skipppr.jpeg" width=322.5 height=480 style="float:right;gap;margin-left:20px">
{{</bruh>}}

You must have been one of the first people that I met during my first year of Computer Science in Stellenbosch who I really clicked with in the academic sense of the word. We all make friends with whom we have similar interests but some just have a more focused interest that aligns with one's self - that is who you were Skiqqy (previously known as _"Skippy"_). Our first conversation took place whilst sitting on the floor outside NARGA D waiting for our first tutorial session on a hot summers day. Somehow we got onto discussing what languages we did at school, Java was thrown around and Delphi as well (which was definitely your favorite ;)).

From there somehow I mentioned my newfound love I had with the D programming language - some people were taken aback but basically just you and your commandeering presence of knowledge on the topic. It came out of leftwing, nobody was expecting it. From such a simple encounter I think I made enough of an impact to begin our friendship from that day onwards.

I really remember just how smart you were with mathematics. Sitting every day in Mathematics 114 where you had such a clear grasp on set theory and limits - whilst I didn't (probably also because I wasn't paying much attention). Later on, we study in the Physics library (of which I had no access to but Nicholas would give to me now and then) and I remember those pivotal 20 minutes before an exam where we would all ask each other questions and then equally confuse one another either by misunderstanding or one of us being wrong (can't be me ;)).

{{</bruh>}}

We had a lot of fun together, if it wasn't the mathematics exams then it was most definitely the fun we had with Linux. Oh, the memories we had together. My first steps of subversive propaganda must have been shilling Fedora to you, once you switched to it I had to continue on with the brainwashing tactics. The gateway drug of tiling window managers. What started off as a possibly morbid curiosity of mine to try and Hacker-maxx in order to find all the i3 honeys on campus quickly turned into a legitimate love for the i3 window manager, so much so that what started off as me joking about a minimalist window manager actually convinced you to use it and subsequently me sticking to it.

The o-so many nights spent at The Happy Oak having a blast there, drinking a healthy amount of rum and coke (2 for 1 special despite the price increase possibly nullifying it).

Somehow when it came to computer programming, I somehow had luckily found someone who truly was in the same realm of me in terms of ongoing hobby projects and interests. Not too mention some cheeky so-called "hipster humor" here and there which really put the cherry on-top.

Lastly, someone who looked at themselves and was committed to bettering themselves - no matter the cost. That's you Stephen and keep on pushing forward in that direction because your eventual destination is only a few blocks down the line.

I can't wait to start work with you next year - it's going to be a blast man! _Just like good old times_

You lot are a special bunch honestly. I am so happy I met you guys - however it happened I am happy that it did, and damn Mr Mouton is such a chad.

If I may indulge you in the following quotes about our friend group (or _family_ rather - because that's what we are - a little familia):

### Lauren Abrahall

{{<bruh>}}
<img src="/img/thanks_again/lauren_1.jpeg" width=258 height=330 style="float:left;gap;margin-right:20px">

Our friendship is like the original `a.out` [Binary Executable Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.out) for Linux in the 21st century era - _"We somehow shouldn't be compatible but we are"_. On a serious note though having a friend with a witty sense of humor and ability to take and make some rather "based" jokes is something I did not think I would have originally found within you. Having crossed paths with each other during some rather momentous moments in my life (what we refer to as dealing with people from Gauteng) it really showed that you had a good heart and were there to help me through tough times. Your care and affection are greatly appreciated and hold a special place in my heart.

However, as they say _"tough times never last, only tough people last"_ because boy did we have a blast in that first semester of university - never had I had such an absolute blast of a time. If it wasn't the huis danses (and Alex carrying Lin√© on the red carpet), then it was our dance moves and pasta cooking coupled with explosive red wine staining your jeans and my room's cealing. Spending time together, listening to music on my turn table and having a really good time was much appreciated. To sum it up you're a kind hearted individual with a huge amount of courage (and a good aim on a 9mm) and very smart (thanks for the CV help).

The evenings we spent in the lab working tirelessly on some stupid algos assignment to which we'd easily find the answer too after pulling one of these bad boys off:

```java
throw new RuntimeException(System.in.readLine());
```

Was a great way to bond with each other - a friendship forged in fire - in this case the fire that was Willem's incessant releasing of assignments. Just when you thought you'd completed all three programming assignments he would hit you with another. Thankfully you and I were both prepared, you with you immense knowledge and me pitching up to the lab with a corkscrew and a bottle of Clint's finest wine. _"Rainbow's End Cabernet Franc Lauren?"_ to which you'd answer _"Just a little bit"_, and by the end of the evening I would have finished the whole bottle. The fond memories I have doing those assignments with you in first semester wasn't because I saw you simply as a friend who would be able to assist me with my work, no, I saw it as time spent having fun together because we'd be able to have to much fun over the mundane things before, after and in-between. Didn't have dinner before we started working? Well, let's go over to my flat and cook some pasta, listen to some Il Mondo and have some wine before we head back to the lab to push out some work for the evening. When the work go a little bit too hard and we needed a break then we chatted for a long time, browsing the internet and sometimes discussing rather _interesting_ things - to say the least.

{{<bruh>}}

{{</bruh>}}

I think that is what I got a lot out of this friendship, something different. A person who was very different to me and had a lot to open my mind to. The amount of utter shenanigans we were able to get up to at this university actually astounds me. If it wasn't [LARPing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action_role-playing_game) as a married couple (failing to convince people that Ben was our son, however, to my disappointment) to skirt around some seating restrictions then it is playing 4D chess (instead of checkers) with people and damn it was a fun time.

On a more serious note though. We didn't always have to agree Lauren, we just had to always have each other's back and there were most definitely some pivotal moments in this year where I was assured you'd have my back - and you showed me you did. Forever grateful I am; God bless your soul.

I remember the first time meeting you Line, it was you I and Lauren all in the lab sitting at our desks and we were all so encumbered just by the difficulty of _Digital Image Processing_ (DIP) and its assignments. Now, I say that with a grain of salt knowing just how **much harder** Computer Vision would be and that DIP would be seen as a cakewalk effectively. Through this time period which was only within the first few weeks of university I recall sitting opposite you in the "hot seats" table in the lab and us having small talk now ands then about our work and assignments. Even through what I thought ws the really tough times - the beginning of Algos, you were always there to re-assure me and cheer me on as I made progress through the theoretical work that I so much struggled with. It was these early days which cemented in my head the good nature of who you were as a person - one of the most caring and in-touch souls I have ever come across. Never once did you do anyone wrong even when faced by those who did you wrong - you were a quiet hero but an extremely strong one at that - both mentally, emotionally and physically. Someone who is a dependable friend, always there and always complimentary. If someone accomplished something, got hired for a job, or just got a good mark even - you were someone that always complimented them and in my case - me - for such accomplishments. One would think that such a value is the baseline for being a good human being - and it is - but the amount of people I have come to know has shown that clearly these well-established set of principles, morals and virtues are apparently not so important. Thankfully, you **do** appreciate such ideals and it makes a great person out of you.

All of this is great but what is _really_ of importance is your enjoyment of knives - now I would call myself a firearms _enjoyer_, hell even a _coinnisuer_ but I would never be able to put myself on the same level as that of someone who is a knives enthusiast - and oh boy did you have a very tasteful selection of them. Needless to say, you're a real bok for sport and it's refreshing having a friend who is always keen to get a bruise on their knee once in a while, whether it be rock climbing or any of the things one can get up to in the great outdoors of Stellenbosch.

Your laughter, appreciation for humor and smile brings a lot of joy to those who surround you in their lives - and I'm one of those people. It's small things like this, not necessarily grandiose things such as wealth and so forth, that I appreciate in people and I do admit that one can underappreciate them sometimes but we need to count our blessings that good people with caring intensions are out there and that they're the people we ought to surround ourselves with.

### Alexander Mouton

{{<bruh>}}
<img src="/img/thanks_again/alex_1.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="float:left;gap;margin-right:20px">
{{</bruh>}}

This man is such a gentleman, a classy fellow. Nothing really can match the _panashe_, the so-called _je ne sais quoi_, of this individual - I mean just look at the photo. His hair, the way he grasps the glass and last but not least - his choice of beverage. This man makes his own gin - he is so cool, Aurum Madidus it is. The golden heart of this person is immeasurable, if it isn't helping me with Data Science (because God help me trying to do anything with KMeans and KNN clustering) then its giving me a taste of his amazing gin, playing the piano whilst I code away on my compiler in the most tranquil environment. Cultured aspects aside, this man has always been a supportive person with whom one could confide and seek advice - a person who understood exactly everything I could have possibly been going through - without even having to mention a single word.

I must say, you do really have one of the nicest and most "pimped out" computer setup I have ever seen. For the untrained eye, you may look like a typical _"stock bro"_ when you have your trading bot graphs opened, or a gamer when you simply just have your machine idling. However, what people seem to miss with you is that you are more than that - you are a scientific computing enjoyer. I recall a discussion we had late into this year - near the end - where I posed the question:

> Me: "Alex don't you think that the way many are writing software is extremely inefficient?"

> Alex: "Yes. Yes I do"

{{<bruh>}}
<img src="/img/thanks_again/alex_2.jpeg" width=240 height=320 style="float:right;gap;margin-left:20px">
{{</bruh>}}

And with that very strong (and correct opinion - I am not even going to debate this with anyone - especially those who believe webapps are "moral") I knew that this guy is a _man amongst men_. This guy shares a view with me that we should strive to implement things efficiently and that just because you can do something because you have a lot of RAM (and Alex has 96 gigabytes of it) doesn't mean you should be wasteful. It very much could have been the way you were brought up - if your parents say never waste food or money and make the most of it - which I get the feeling your 'rents would have done. Then one can easily see why you have such a righetous and correct factual objective "opinion" (air quotes because it's a fact). You're going to be successful for that way of thinking man, not only in programming but in general. For the programming side of things you will end up writing code that you really can be proud of - where you know the inner workings or how optimizations can successfully be applied - and not just haphazardly applied as some people do who lack the understanding of how the nitty gritty of certain libraries and algorithmns work.

Very few people are willing to let you come over at any time to their appartement to chill or relax - I have never had a friend more welcoming in that sense. I must commend you for that Mr Mouton - you were raised well. Your welcoming spirit is something I haven't come across in many of my friends in that sense - it is greatly appreciated ans meant more to me than it may have seemed. Not to mention all the banter that would follow as soon as Rhyn arrived late in the evening and then all of the funny stories started coming out - those were great and my word still make me chuckle to this day but are forever sealed from leaving my lips. Your love for cooking interesting vegetable-stews and sharing this with your friends is definately a highlight of coming over - I always leave feeling incredibly healthy.

This man could honestly be the next president of South Africa if he really wanted to - but as he had made a better choice to study something in the sciences (something free of scandals) I will not be able to refer to him as President-elect Boschoff for the remainder of this peace.

Simeon, you are an upstanding individual - an image of what a good gentlemanly person should aspire to be. You're hard working, diplomatic and incredibly kind - the amount of time you put into organizing various activities whether it be the Illusive Computer Science hoodies, to having to deal with the problems at Huis Marais, and countless other things that were separate from your degree of which was very demanding as well - you somehow came out of it with a postgraduate degree, a job and an amazing set of friends. You really pushed yourself, never once without a smile on your face and always willing to spend time with those close to you - I appreciated this always. Having your presence in the lab was always great. The countless times we spent together poking fun at certain (hint: _"A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface."_) GP drivers in our class in the name of fun were very memorable events.

Between this and what follows there was a great amount of influence you had over me, especially when it came to your wealth of knowledge on modern technology. For starters, my addiction to my mechanical keyboard would have never begun if it was not for you to convince me to purchase one of these bad boys. I had so much fun learning all about these things with you and you really opened my eyes to a world I knew nothing about - I have had so much joy just merely _discussing_ these things with you and it has a special place in my memory you and your taste in _"timeless pieces"_ such as your Pagani Design watch - you're a tasteful and cultured fellow - I can give you that.

Whenever I wanted to strike up a conversation with you about something in current affairs I always felt your brought something to the table - something well thought through and many a time it would be things I was totally unaware of. You are a well-spoken individual and it really shows - there's a reason my parents think so highly of you - and so do **I**. There's a lot that we really did at a core level share and have in common when it came to some of our core beliefs and it was always comforting to know I could come to someone with my ideas, worries or inner thoughts that would be able to understand them, stay just the way you are man. You're an extremely likeable person with a strong character and set of values and highly respectable.

~~Boyd Kane~~ _**Thee** Boyd Kane_ (I am so sorry for ever having mispronounced your name - it should be a crime to not prefix it with **Thee**) you my friend are an amazing individual. You were one of my first friends at the beginning of the year, I infact remember meeting you for one of the very first times after I broke off things with that lady from Gauteng (~~a story for another day~~ you'll never hear it - it's too cringe) and the support you offered me is a memory that has stuck in my head as one of _"the bros"_ who was there for me in a one of my _"tough times"_ - things like this stay with me because I know now who was there for me in those times and it's an underappreciated act of goodwill I think - so I just want you to know how much I appreciated that. In any case, let's not spend much time thinking about anything Gauteng-related because I might just declare the Cape independent if I continue on this tangent.

The thing I found with you that I never found with anyone else, was your love for programming and the intricacies of it. You loved low-level programming, if anything you went lower than I did with your amazing honors project which incorporated electronic egineering, microcontrollers and interfacing with them. Your love for Rust - an inherently systems-based programming language. You were in the same league as I and it resulted in endless discussions between you and I about the things we were working on at any given time. Your ability to keep a keen ear on the topic at hand that I was discussing and your interest in the topic was something I never really experienced in any of my friends before - and not to blame them - not everyone loves compilers, but finding this quality within you was something I enjoyed so much about coming into the lab everyday and seeing you walk through that door. You were always keen to ask me how things were going with my compiler or in general, always listened and a lot of the time gave great advice and thought deeply alongside me on certain problems. That sort of in depth interest on the same subject matter as mine was something I hadn't found in a person before - and there's so much of it we still need to share toghether.

Catching you for a quick coffee which turned into an hour-long discussion about Haskell's monads or what [point-free programming](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Pointfree_programming) was were some of the things I really enjoyed about the time I spent with you at Stellenbosch, you pushed my brain in an academic sense and it was so fun to have something in common with a friend in the realm of programming because it really is rare.

You're an amazing computer programmer, your skills are really unmatched and when you are not indulging _yourself_ in programming you are indulging others' - and it's a quality you should never lose.

> _"Halo Sir I am under water, please help me"_

Such famous words uttered by a great orator, Barack Obama. Ben, my friend, I have a lot to say about you. You are indeed what I would refer to as _**an interesting fella**_. Although you hailed from Wits you seem to have fit just right in with the Stellenbosch crowd or, atleast, the comoyuter scientists (we're all a quirky weird bunch, as much as I'd like to deny being a "quirky male" ~~I prefer schizo male~~). I, for one, am very happy for this because I think that if I hadn't met you that I would have had a very different year. There are many reasons for this ranging from your sense of humor, your knowledge on topics that I mutually enjoyed and also your willingness to always help me out when in need. These are characteristics that are not necessarily that common or at least to the degree you portrayed them in is not common. Your endless support in that manner has been greatly appreciated.

As for mutually shared topics of interests well, there's a lot we could go over. Firstly, your knowledge of memes is amazing, it's at the very least on par with my knowledge which is great but at the very most you posess Telegram Channel operator energy. Somehow you had the ability to recount every single utterance of every popular meme in what I found hilarious and sometimes quite amazing at the amount of intellectual "meme capacity" that you had.

Secondly, and more importantly, you had a lot of knowledge on programming at a level that I could identify with. Design patterns and principles, networking, writing big systems and the list goes on. You and I both had passion projects that we worked tirelessly on for a long time and I was able to bond with you over that. We loved dicusssing programming languages and your favourite C#. There were, however, some stumblings blocks to this friendship as with any there is. Specifically, your use of the `var` keyword was rather worrying, I felt as if I had lost a part of my friend to the luciferian type-inference shills but as with people we all share slight differences in our closely knit friend groups - without these differences we would all be the same and would ould be left to make us any different from one another then.

I really enjoyed the time we spent toghether hiking up Coetzenberg in the early Stellenbosch mornings, walking in that nestled beauty that is the spiraling pathway of Coetzenberg. Finishing this, you taking us for a drive down Dorp street to _Adam and Eve_ to get a bagel ü•ØÔ∏è whilst we listening to DJ Paulie (or whatever that fella's name was) play some beats on his turntable.

You're a smart fella, and a good lad. Thanks boet.

Now I could have easily copied and pasted the kind words I had written for you [last year](../thank_you_all/) but what would be the point in that - I have an endless amount that I could write about us two - because as each year progresses it only gets better. What is _it_? Its our friendship - one that is coming up on roughly 4 years now and one that I will never forget. In could very much have said within the early days of our friendship that it was like any other but as events had transpired down the line you were one of the very few friends who knew me well enough to help me through extremely pivotal moments in my life that, had you not been there, would have left me in a place of approach the _downwards spiral_. What I learnt from you was a good idea that had so easily left my headspace - the idea of moderacy - a time and a place but most importantly the size of a portion. Now, this may seem obvious to many but to me at a certain stage in life hearing these words was all I really needed. Needless to say, I hedge a lot if not most of the value I put on our friendship on those very few dark chapters in my life. I could go on to say a lot about who you are as a person - and oh boy I will - but I want you to know that was the truest form of friendship. No beach house, wine will buy me those moments again in life - but your solid heart of gold and principled take on life taught me how to be an actual man.

You're a man of steal Troy - it took me time to understand it all but I am happy I had a mentor like you to come to terms with reality. For anyone else reading this, it may seem inoccuous but to summarize. This man stood by his words, instead of just saying one thing and doing another. He was a gentleman and best of all he could balance that with actually having a good sense of humor. It's as if he found the perfect ratio of them both - he then passed me this knowledge and I keep it in my head everyday.

Now, sob story aside, let's talk about this `f e l l a`. So, I met this absolute chad-maxxing individual/sir/mr during Operations Research 214 - remember that annoying graph theory class. Now, khalahari aside, I first was unsure how to approach this fella. Firstly he was sitting at the same table as me with his headphones on and using his iPad to take notes. Already, I then knew this man was a serious fella - he had no emotions on his face - in a sense he was Bateman-maxxing before I even knew that was a thing. Man probably had Dineplan open with a premium account to get a reservation at Dorsia's but I digress. Somehow it came about that Thomas Theron and Troy had struck up a friendship between each other and this lead us to forming a study group where we'd attempt to pass that wretched module by having group study sessions in the Student Sentrum (or _SS_ for short), now the wifi was rather **sus** in this studey center, if you were in one of the study rooms on the second floor, so perhaps we should refer to it as the *Sus Sentrum*. In any case, we spent a lot of time in those rooms doing more banter and shit talking than we did studying but when we did study we really worked well toghether us three. We had a very good time toghether studying that stuff and I bonded pretty well with this fella there, mainly because I realised this guy had an amazing sense of humor that he shared with me - from then it was just like that - we clicked. I knew I wanted to have this person around me.

As the years progressed we passed our second year and went into our third, at this time I was still carrying the weight of failing Applied Mathematics 144 (basically school physics - which I never did) on my shoulders kinda like sisyphus (the rock pushing fella), so we had our hands tide in the sense we were all rather busy _but_ that never stopped us from having fun. We had multiple evenings we'd spend at each other's flats or at Thomas's, drinking a good glass or two of red üç∑Ô∏è and eating some good steak that this chef, Troy himself, so well prepared. If it wasn't that, it was this absolute gentleman providing my chronical-pedestrian-self with transport within Stellenbosch and a year ago all the way to Buffel's Bay - a trip which without him would not be a memory at all. We have had such great times toghether and despite our disagreements on things (which honestly isn't all too much) we have a bond which I cannot say exists with any of my other friends. A type of comradarie, an implicit trust or understanding - a friendship that has been put through tests but at the end we stood side by side and both came out as genuine proper gentlemen.

You're a good lad Troy, a hard worker, extremely principled and you have always had my back _even when I didn't know it_ - I'll never take it forgranted.

## The climbers

What do you get when you have three people that can be classified into these three classes:

1. A Gautenger
2. A boermeisie van Worcester af
3. An American from Idaho

~~Yet another incident at Stellenbosch University~~ You get something that has been one of the best parts of my last few months here in Stellenbosch - a group of friends that whatever their quirks are - were some of the most supportive, confidence-boosting and wholesome people that I have come across.

### Justin Dewitt

Firstly, Justin De Witt, you my friend are an amazing person. I hadn't done any sort of exercise since leaving school, just some walking here and there on Coetzenberg and then you came along and suggested I join the rock climbing club - or as I have come to affectionately refer to it as _"The Rockies ü™®Ô∏è"_. I didn't know how well I would do the first time I went bouldering but with your presence and complimentary ways you made it such that every time I climbed I kept pushing myself, trying to do better - finding new routes and then accomplishing them. This trait of yours to give people such confidence boosts - even in the worst of times - is something I very much appreciate about you. You helped me grow as a person and showed me what kindness, compassion and growth looks like.

Second to all of these good characteristics you're a solid person, and that isn't just what my dad thought of you when you came over for dinner. No, it's something I have given thought to for quite some time. You put your head down, you get through the work ahead of you and you hardly complain - unless it's about getting good marks for Data Science `;)`. Being keen to socialise with me in the middle of no-where (Worcester) when many others would either not be able to make it was something that I could really identify with, Worcester is a quiet place but you make it a little less so and the next few weeks I hope to make the most of it in that regard with you.

Both of our interests couldn't be further apart but we do both share a passion to do excellent work and to do it well. I think you out do me in that sense though. You have an heir of prefessionalism and 100%-a-tism in the sense that you won't release anything to the world until its completely done and you are very proud of it. In a sense, you hide pride in favor of remaining humble as to not let anything like those fickle traits get in the way of not just doing menial work but rather excellent work - at the end you have all the reason to celebrate such feats. You're a hard worker and have a lot of admirable traits I could learn from.

Anke, despite having noticed your red hair in first year where you stood out in the whole class of Maths 114 students, I never actually spoke to you. I just observed a first year girl go from having no long board to _having_ a long board. Many years went by and when I had my "re-union with Justin" and you came to hang in the lab with us, often enjoying a glass of wine with us two we started chatting and got very much along. This should have never come to a surprise to me seeing as we were both Worcesterites - i.e. being born in Worcester - something I hold very near and dear to my heart in a prideful sense. Many evenings in the lab with the rockies proved to be great fun, going to Holy Dough for a nice slice of Pizza, buying a great set of vinyl records from you and then climbing in the evening topped off with a bowl of rice from Pandas.

### Bernartd Steyn

**TODO:** Check that name is spelt correctly

Despite all the banter that we shared toghether at every possible moment when we were within a few meters of each other, whether it be in the lab, whilst demi-ing (when we were meant to be answering those annoying questions) or at the climbing wall. I enjoyed the banter a lot but more what I enjoyed was that past all of it you were always a person interested in programming. Wanting to know how my compiler was going, how work was going and also sharing your experiences with programming projects of your own with me. Despite me maybe not making it very obvious to you, I really appreciated the company and talks we had together. It was always a welcome conversation whatever we chatted to each other about and was a reason for me to look forward to the CS244 demi-ing sessions each Friday - despite others not necessartily holding that patciular sentiment. Dankie Bernardt.
