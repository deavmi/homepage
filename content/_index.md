# Tristan B. Velloza Kildaire
## _An enthusiastic engineer_

I'm Tristan B. Velloza Kildaire (or _deavmi_ on the Internet) and I'm a computer programmer. I love tinkering around with all the bits of software
that my computer runs but typically more on the low-level sides of things. I'm really interested in how operating systems work as a whole
and their components such as kernels, networking stacks, linking-loaders, IPC, paging, virtual memory, file-systems and the list goes on. There's
so much to learn from understanding these complex systems and each aspect of them never leaves me bored! I really enjoy the C programming language,
coupled with your console editor of choice and a few man pages at hand - you can do a lot with this powerful combo.

You could call me a language enthusiast, from the design to the implementation. I always want to know how things work and I've even spent time reading the source code for some language runtimes to get a better understanding. If I am feeling creative then I try write my own _or_ write something in Forth! I love building networks too - I have an interest in setting up inter-networks with routing protocols, assigning numbers and setting up tunnels in order to build a huge network that I can play around on. When I'm not using other peoples' protocols I am busy writing my own to see what I can cobble out to itch my scratch on trying interesting concepts out.

I like a good glass of red wine and cheese. I have an avid enjoyment for music from the 70s and the 80s and have rather interesting political views (nothing to be alarmed of) but most importantly I like to help others learn and put a smile on their face.

## See what I am working on

You can head over to the [projects page](/projects) to see what I am working on (or have worked on) and then once you're done there you can head on over to my blog to read some computer musings.

## Connect with me

I'm active on a few social media platforms and post regularly (or not) but I definitely do
check these platforms now and then so if you want to discuss something then it isn't a bad
way to get in touch and also stay up-to-date with updates regarding to new blog posts or
projects.
