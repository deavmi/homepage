# Tristan B. Velloza Kildaire

I'm Tristan B. Kildaire (or _deavmi_ on the Internet) and I'm a computer programmer. I love tinkering around with all the bits of software
that my computer runs but typically more on the low-level sides of things. I'm really interested in how operating systems work as a whole
and their components such as kernels, networking stacks, linking-loaders, IPC, paging, virtual memory, file-systems and the list goes on. There's so much to learn from understanding these complex systems and each aspect of them never leaves me bored!

You could call me a language enthusiast, from the design to the implementation. I always want to know how things work and I've even spent time reading the source code for some language runtimes to get a better understanding. If I am feeling creative then I try write my own _or_ write something in Forth! I love building networks too - I have an interest in setting up inter-networks with routing protocols, assigning numbers and setting up tunnels in order to build a huge network that I can play around on. When I'm not using other peoples' protocols I am busy writing my own to see what I can cobble out to itch my scratch on trying interesting concepts out.

I like a good glass of red wine and cheese. I have an avid enjoyment for music from the 70s and the 80s and have rather interesting political views (nothing to be alarmed of) but most importantly I like to help others learn and put a smile on their face.

## Explore some more

You can head over to the [projects page](/projects) to see what I am working on (or have worked on) and then once you're done there you can head on over to my blog to read some computer musings.

You can reach this site via many more [networks](networks/) (such as I2P and CRXN).

If you like what I _do_ and don't mind shilling a _few_ then you can send me some Internet money (note I don't accept PayPal or any centralised service) or a gold certificate. The aim of the donations are to show appreciation for my work. If, however, you are interested in donating to one of my projects (whereby the money goes towards it) then please find the respective donation link on their project pages.
