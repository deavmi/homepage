Get in contact with me! I can maybe help you build something if you need it. 

## Networking help

I have quite a lot of experience with building physical networks with hardware such as **Mikrotik**
both with _RouterOS_ and also some _OpenWRT_ experience. This includes things such as VLAN switching,
OSPF routing, IPv6 subnetting, WiFi and more!

## Software development

I can aid you with software development. I have experience in C, D, Java and Python.
