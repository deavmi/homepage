My research and development project that I worked on during my honours year of 2022 was on the topic of _"Explicit sequencing of C programs"_ whereby I looked
at ways to improve the current state of **Software Verification** in [Lazy-CSeq]() with regards to the underspecified evaluation ordering of function
arguments and binary operators in the C programming language. The transformation module was written in Python2 (as is standard with CSeq).
