## Work experience

### ![iPay (January 2023 to _present_)](ipay)

Since joining [iPay](https://www.ipay.co.za/) I have been the lead architect and engineer on their Hydra project. This brand new head-end system (HES) has been built in order to allow for a wide variety of devices (mostly smart meters) to be interacted with in a uniform way.

I am tasked with the design of the hardware abstraction layer (HAL) for the drivers that I am some others on my team have built. Along with this I work on the task scheduler which is used to schedule and run tasks on the remote devices. This scheduler is comprised of an extensible queue policy framework (QPF) which allows filters (stateful and stateless) to manage which jobs and when get to be executed.

I am the main maintainer of the DLMS-related code and also the DLT645 driver, the latter which I wrote entirely from scratch.

I have quite a lot of experience in concurrency from I/O, to condition variables, locks,
streaming I/O, buffer encoding/decoding and more. I have implemented a lot of custom
internal libraries from scratch that make heavy use of these concepts.

The codebase is written in Java.
